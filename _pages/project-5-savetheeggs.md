## Save the Eggs 

[Github](https://github.com/RohitBagda/SaveEggsGame)

Save the Eggs is a mobile game developed with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and the Phaser game engine. The objective of the game is to save as many eggs as possible by catching them in the bucket. Touch and drag the bucket from side to side across the screen and catch the falling eggs. Catching a bomb will subtract a life. The user has three lives to spare before the game ends. Failure to catch an egg will subtract points from the score. The game will end if the user's score reaches zero this way. The game was deployed on [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/save-the-egg-2018/id1396977295) and Google Playstore.
