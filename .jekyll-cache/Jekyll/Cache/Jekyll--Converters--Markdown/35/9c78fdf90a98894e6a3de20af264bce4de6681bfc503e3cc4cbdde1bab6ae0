  <p>Hi! I‚Äôm a second-year PhD student at Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering at the University of Washington. I work with <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~reinecke/">Katharina Reinecke</a> and <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rjust/">Ren√© Just</a>. I am exploring ways to anticipate and mitigate unintended consequences of emerging computing technologies. Currently I am automatically identifying discussion on societal implication online from newspapers, Twitter, and Reddit. I am also interested in building tools that make statistical analysis more approachable to novice users. In the past, I have designed tools to improve preregistration experience to increase the reproducibility of studies and prevent selection reporting bias.</p>

  <p>I spent four wonderful years at Macalester College, where I worked with <a href="https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/facultystaff/shiladsen/">Shilad Sen</a> to visualize Wikipedia articles as maps. Originally intending to study politics, I became more interested how I could use data to convey and visualize ever-changing information contained in the complex and pluralistic global community. In college, I majored in computer science, applied math &amp; statistics and minored in political science.</p>
